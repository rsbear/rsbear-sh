Okay, so admittedly I've been kind of fanboying about the edge for the past few months; it's probably a good time to take a step back and pragmatically evaluate. We're going to skip the part where we talk about what it is and just start juicing this melon.

The philosophy alone is enticing; I mean come on.. globally distrubuted compute layer sitting right next to the cache. Leverage that compute layer to generate HTML, chefs kiss - that page is basically generated and served from the users backyard. As a result, the whole extremely difficult problem of latency and vertical scaling is pretty much solved.

To be continued...
