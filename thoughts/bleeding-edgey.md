Okay, so admittedly I've been kind of fanboying about the edge for the past few months; it's probably a good time to take a step back and pragmatically evaluate.

What's up, why so fascinated by it? At a philosophical level, the edge is awesome. I mean come on, globally distributed run time for computations and a few solid caching options, if using Cloudflare at least. It's undeniably a really captivating attempt at a solution to the problem of latency.
